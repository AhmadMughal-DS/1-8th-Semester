## üéØ Introduction to Ethical Theories

### Why Study Multiple Ethical Theories?

**Think of ethical theories like tools in a toolbox:**
- Different problems need different tools
- No single theory solves every ethical dilemma
- Understanding multiple perspectives helps make better decisions

**Key Understanding:**
Some theories say morality is **relative** (changes based on person/culture), while others say morality is **objective** (universal truths exist).

## üìñ Overview of Nine Ethical Theories

### Quick Reference Table

| Theory | Type | Core Principle | Main Question |
|--------|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Subjective Relativism** | Relative | Each person decides | What's right for you? |
| **Cultural Relativism** | Relative | Each culture decides | What does your culture say? |
| **Divine Command Theory** | Objective | God decides | What does God command? |
| **Ethical Egoism** | Objective | Self-interest | What benefits me most? |
| **Kantianism** | Objective | Duty & universal rules | Would I want everyone to do this? |
| **Act Utilitarianism** | Objective | Greatest happiness | Does this maximize total happiness? |
| **Rule Utilitarianism** | Objective | Best rules for society | What rule maximizes happiness? |
| **Social Contract Theory** | Objective | Rights & agreements | Does this respect rights? |
| **Virtue Ethics** | Objective | Good character | What would a virtuous person do? |

## üåç PART 1: Relativistic Theories

### 2.2 Subjective Relativism

#### Core Idea

**"What's right for you may not be right for me"**

Each individual decides their own moral truth. There are no universal standards of right and wrong.

#### Key Principles

**Individual Authority:**
- You are the ultimate judge of your actions
- Your feelings determine right and wrong
- No external authority can tell you what's moral

**Example Scenario:**

> **Person A:** "Downloading pirated movies is fine because entertainment should be free"
> **Person B:** "Downloading pirated movies is theft because creators deserve payment"
> 
> **Subjective Relativism says:** Both are correct in their own view!

#### Real-Life Application

**Workplace Scenario:**
> **Situation:** Company has a casual dress code
> - **Employee 1:** "I think wearing shorts is professional enough"
> - **Employee 2:** "I think only formal wear is professional"
> 
> **Subjective Relativism:** Both employees are "right" according to their personal standards

#### Arguments FOR Subjective Relativism

**1. People Genuinely Disagree**
- Intelligent people have different moral views
- No way to prove one person's view is "right"

**Example:**
> Capital punishment: Some believe it's justice, others believe it's murder. Who is objectively correct?

**2. Reduces Conflict**
- No point arguing about morality
- Everyone respects each other's views
- Less judgmental society

#### Arguments AGAINST Subjective Relativism

**1. Blurs Doing Right vs. Doing What You Want**

**Problem:** If you decide what's right, "right" just means "what I feel like doing"

**Example:**
> **Person:** "I think stealing is okay if I need the money"
> **Issue:** This isn't moral reasoning‚Äîit's just justifying desire

**2. No Moral Distinction Between Actions**

**Problem:** Can't say Hitler was wrong if he thought genocide was right

**Example:**
> - **Person A:** Helps homeless people (thinks it's right)
> - **Person B:** Robs homeless people (thinks it's right)
> 
> **Subjective Relativism:** Both are equally "moral" in their own view!
> **Common Sense:** This is absurd‚Äîclearly one action is better

**3. Confuses Tolerance with Truth**

**Important Distinction:**
- **Tolerance:** Respecting others' right to their view
- **Truth:** Whether that view is actually correct

**Example:**
> You can tolerate someone's belief that Earth is flat (not harass them) while still saying they're factually wrong

**4. Decisions Not Based on Reason**

**Problem:** "I feel this is right" isn't a logical argument

**Example:**
> **Bad reasoning:** "I think lying to customers is fine because it increases sales and I want a bonus"
> **This doesn't address:** Why is your desire more important than customers' right to truth?

#### Conclusion: Not a Workable Theory

**Why it fails:**
- Can't persuade others (everyone's view is equal)
- Can't judge obvious evil (Hitler, mass murderers)
- Based on feelings, not logic
- Doesn't help make difficult decisions

### 2.3 Cultural Relativism

#### Core Idea

**"When in Rome, do as the Romans do"**

Morality is determined by cultural norms. What's right in one society may be wrong in another.

#### Key Principles

**Cultural Authority:**
- Your society's moral guidelines determine right and wrong
- Morality varies across cultures and time periods
- No universal moral truths exist

**Example Scenarios:**

**Historical Example:**
> **Ancient Rome:** Gladiator fights to death = entertainment (morally acceptable)
> **Modern America:** Such fights = murder (morally wrong)
> 
> **Cultural Relativism:** Both cultures are "right" in their own context

**Contemporary Example:**
> **Saudi Arabia:** Women must cover their hair (moral requirement)
> **United States:** Women choose their clothing (moral freedom)
> 
> **Cultural Relativism:** Neither culture can judge the other

#### Real-World Application

**Business Scenario:**
> **Bribery:**
> - **In some cultures:** Expected part of business (not seen as wrong)
> - **In other cultures:** Illegal and immoral
> 
> **Question:** Should a multinational corporation follow local norms or universal standards?

**Tech Industry Example:**
> **Data Privacy:**
> - **Europe (GDPR):** Strict data protection, user consent required
> - **Some Asian countries:** More relaxed standards
> 
> **Cultural Relativism:** Companies should follow each region's norms

#### Arguments FOR Cultural Relativism

**1. Different Contexts Demand Different Rules**

**Example:**
> **Inuit Culture (Arctic):**
> - Limited resources, harsh conditions
> - Elderly sometimes left to die to save food for children
> - In their context, this ensures survival of the group
> 
> **Modern Western Culture:**
> - Abundant resources
> - Extensive elderly care
> - Leaving elderly to die would be murder
> 
> **Cultural Relativism:** Both are appropriate for their context

**2. Arrogance of Judging Others**

**Argument:** Who are we to impose our values on another culture?

**Historical Example:**
> **Colonialism:** Western powers imposed their "superior" morality
> - Destroyed native cultures
> - Justified exploitation as "civilizing"
> 
> **Lesson:** Claiming moral superiority has led to atrocities

#### Arguments AGAINST Cultural Relativism

**1. "Is" Doesn't Mean "Ought"**

**Problem:** Just because cultures DO have different values doesn't mean they SHOULD

**Example:**
> **Nazi Germany:** Society believed Aryan supremacy was right
> 
> **Cultural Relativism says:** Can't judge them
> **Common Sense says:** Obviously, we can and should judge genocide as wrong

**2. Doesn't Explain How Norms Are Determined**

**Problem:** Who decides what the "cultural norm" is?

**Example:**
> **Pakistan:** Mix of traditional and modern values
> - Some say women must wear hijab
> - Others say women should dress freely
> - Both claim to represent "cultural values"
> 
> **Question:** Which represents the true cultural norm?

**3. What If No Clear Cultural Norm Exists?**

**Problem:** Cultures aren't monolithic

**Example:**
> **Abortion in the United States:**
> - Half the culture: Pro-life (abortion is murder)
> - Half the culture: Pro-choice (woman's right)
> 
> **Cultural Relativism:** Can't help because no clear norm exists

**4. Doesn't Account for Moral Evolution**

**Problem:** How do cultures improve morally if current norms are always "right"?

**Example:**
> **Slavery in America:**
> - **1800s:** Cultural norm = slavery acceptable
> - **Abolitionists:** Fought against cultural norm
> 
> **Cultural Relativism:** Abolitionists were "wrong" to fight against cultural norms
> **Reality:** Abolitionists were moral heroes who improved society

**5. Can't Resolve Conflicting Cultures**

**Problem:** What when two cultures clash?

**Example:**
> **Immigrants in New Cultures:**
> - Home culture allows polygamy
> - New culture forbids polygamy
> 
> **Cultural Relativism:** Both cultures are "right"
> **Reality:** Need to decide which rule applies

**6. Many-Any Fallacy**

**Problem:** Many acceptable practices ‚â† ALL practices acceptable

**Example:**
> - Many hairstyles are acceptable (long, short, bald, colorful)
> - This doesn't mean ALL hairstyles are acceptable (Nazi symbols shaved in hair)

**7. Cultures Share Core Values**

**Reality Check:** All cultures value:
- Protection of innocent
- Truth-telling (at least sometimes)
- Care for children
- Some form of justice

**Example:**
> Every culture punishes murder (even if they define "murder" differently)

#### Conclusion: Not a Workable Theory

**Why it fails:**
- Can't judge obvious cultural evils
- Prevents moral progress
- No way to resolve conflicts
- Doesn't reflect reality (cultures do share values)

## üôè PART 2: Objective Theories (Religious & Egoist)

### 2.4 Divine Command Theory

#### Core Idea

**"Good = What God commands, Evil = What God forbids"**

Morality comes from God's will as revealed in holy books and religious teachings.

#### Key Principles

**Divine Authority:**
- God is the source of all morality
- Holy books provide moral guidance
- Religious leaders interpret God's will
- Obedience to God = moral behavior

#### Sources of Moral Guidance

**Different religions, different sources:**
- **Christianity:** Bible (Old & New Testament)
- **Islam:** Quran and Hadith
- **Judaism:** Torah and Talmud
- **Hinduism:** Vedas and Bhagavad Gita

#### Real-World Application

**Medical Ethics:**
> **End-of-Life Decisions:**
> - **Divine Command Theory:** Life is sacred gift from God
> - **Conclusion:** Euthanasia is wrong regardless of suffering
> - **Basis:** "Thou shalt not kill" + God decides when life ends

**Business Ethics:**
> **Interest on Loans:**
> - **Islamic Divine Command:** Riba (interest) is forbidden
> - **Islamic Banking:** Uses profit-sharing instead of interest
> - **Basis:** Quran explicitly prohibits usury

#### Arguments FOR Divine Command Theory

**1. We Owe Obedience to Our Creator**

**Reasoning:** God gave us life, we owe Him obedience

**Analogy:**
> Parents create and nurture children ‚Üí Children owe parents respect
> God creates and nurtures humans ‚Üí Humans owe God obedience

**2. God is All-Good and All-Knowing**

**Reasoning:**
- God knows what's truly best for us
- God's morality is perfect
- Following God leads to best outcomes

**Example:**
> **Religious perspective on honesty:**
> "Even if lying seems helpful short-term, God knows long-term truth is better"

**3. God is Ultimate Authority**

**Reasoning:**
- Human reasoning is limited and flawed
- God's wisdom is infinite
- When in doubt, God's command provides certainty

#### Arguments AGAINST Divine Command Theory

**1. Different Holy Books Disagree**

**Problem:** Which religion is correct?

**Examples of Disagreements:**

| Issue | Christianity | Islam | Hinduism | Judaism |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Dietary Laws** | Few restrictions | No pork, alcohol | Many are vegetarian | Kosher laws |
| **Dress Code** | Varies widely | Modest covering | Varies | Modest dress |
| **Marriage** | One spouse | Up to 4 wives | Traditionally arranged | One spouse |
| **Alcohol** | Generally allowed | Forbidden | Varies | Allowed |

**Dilemma:**
> If morality comes from holy books, and holy books conflict, how do we determine what's truly moral?

**2. Society is Multicultural and Secular**

**Problem:** Can't base public policy on one religion

**Example:**
> **Blasphemy Laws:**
> - **Religious view:** Insulting religion should be illegal
> - **Secular view:** Free speech protects criticism of religion
> 
> **In pluralistic society:** Need moral framework that doesn't require religious belief

**3. Modern Moral Problems Not in Scripture**

**Problem:** Holy books written centuries ago, don't address modern issues

**Examples of Modern Issues:**

**Artificial Intelligence:**
- Is it moral to create AI that can think?
- Do AI systems have rights?
- **Scripture:** Silent (AI didn't exist)

**Gene Editing (CRISPR):**
- Is it moral to edit human embryos to prevent disease?
- Are we "playing God"?
- **Scripture:** No direct guidance

**Social Media Ethics:**
- Is cyberbullying a sin?
- How much screen time is too much?
- **Scripture:** Doesn't mention internet

**Cryptocurrency:**
- Is Bitcoin speculation like gambling?
- **Scripture:** No guidance on digital currency

**4. Equivalence Fallacy: "The Good" ‚â† "God"**

**Problem:** Circular reasoning

**The Argument:**
1. Why is something good? Because God commands it.
2. Why does God command it? Because it's good.
3. **This is circular!**

**Philosophical Dilemma (Euthyphro's Problem):**
> **Question A:** Is something good because God commands it?
> - **If YES:** Then "good" is arbitrary (God could have commanded anything)
> - **Implication:** If God commanded murder, would murder be good?
> 
> **Question B:** Does God command something because it's good?
> - **If YES:** Then "good" exists independent of God
> - **Implication:** We don't need God to determine morality

**5. Based on Obedience, Not Reason**

**Problem:** "Because God says so" isn't a logical argument

**Scenario:**
> **Question:** "Why is stealing wrong?"
> **Divine Command Theory:** "Because the Bible says 'Thou shalt not steal'"
> **Problem:** Doesn't explain WHY stealing causes harm
> 
> **Better reasoning:** "Stealing violates others' rights, breaks trust, harms society"

#### Conclusion: Not Workable for Pluralistic Society

**Why it fails for our purposes:**
- Requires religious belief (not everyone shares this)
- Can't resolve conflicts between religions
- Doesn't address modern ethical problems
- Not based on reasoning that can persuade skeptics

**Important Note:**
This doesn't mean Divine Command Theory is wrong for believers‚Äîjust that it can't be the basis for ethical decisions in diverse, secular professional environments.

### 2.5 Ethical Egoism

#### Core Idea

**"Do what's best for yourself in the long run"**

Each person should focus exclusively on their own self-interest. The morally right action is the one that provides maximum long-term benefit to yourself.

#### Key Principles

**Self-Interest as Moral Guide:**
- Your own well-being is the primary concern
- Long-term benefit (not short-term pleasure)
- Rational self-interest (not impulsive desires)

**Important Distinction:**
- **Ethical Egoism:** Principled pursuit of long-term self-interest
- **Selfishness:** Impulsive, short-sighted gratification

#### Historical Proponent: Ayn Rand

**Famous Books:**
- **The Fountainhead:** Architect who refuses to compromise vision
- **Atlas Shrugged:** Productive individuals withdraw from society

**Rand's Philosophy:**
- Altruism is immoral (sacrificing yourself for others)
- Pursuing your happiness is highest moral purpose
- Rational self-interest benefits everyone

#### Real-World Application

**Business Scenario:**
> **Starting a Company:**
> **Ethical Egoist Reasoning:**
> - "I start company to make money (self-interest)"
> - "To make money, I must create products people want"
> - "To succeed, I must treat employees well (or they'll leave)"
> - "To grow, I must serve customers excellently"
> 
> **Result:** Pursuing self-interest leads to benefiting others

**Career Decisions:**
> **Ethical Egoist Approach:**
> - Choose career that maximizes your long-term wealth and happiness
> - Don't sacrifice your ambitions for others' expectations
> - Invest in your skills and education
> - Build beneficial relationships (networking is enlightened self-interest)

#### Arguments FOR Ethical Egoism

**1. It's Practical - We're Already Inclined Toward It**

**Argument:** Humans naturally pursue self-interest, so embrace it

**Example:**
> - You're more motivated to work when you benefit
> - You take better care of your own belongings
> - You know your own needs best

**2. Others Can Take Care of Themselves**

**Argument:** Everyone pursuing their own interest is more efficient

**Example:**
> **Charity:**
> **Problem with altruism:** You might give to wrong causes, or enable dependency
> **Ethical Egoism:** Let people take care of themselves; they know their needs best

**3. Community Benefits from Individual Self-Interest**

**Argument:** "Invisible hand" of market‚Äîself-interest creates public good

**Famous Example (Adam Smith):**
> "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."

**Modern Example:**
> **Steve Jobs and Apple:**
> - Jobs pursued his vision (self-interest: wealth, legacy)
> - Created iPhone, revolutionized technology
> - Millions of people benefited
> - Result: Self-interest produced massive public good

**4. Other Moral Principles Rooted in Self-Interest**

**Argument:** Even "altruistic" principles serve self-interest

**Examples:**
- **Honesty:** Protects your reputation
- **Hard work:** Brings you success
- **Keeping promises:** Others will trust and cooperate with you

#### Arguments AGAINST Ethical Egoism

**1. Easy Philosophy ‚â† Best Philosophy**

**Problem:** Just because something is natural doesn't make it moral

**Example:**
> - Eating junk food is natural inclination ‚Üí Doesn't make it good
> - Getting angry is natural ‚Üí Doesn't make it moral
> - Selfishness is natural ‚Üí Doesn't make it ethical

**2. We DO Know What's Good for Others**

**Problem with "Let others handle themselves":**

**Counter-examples:**
> **Children:** Definitely can't take care of themselves
> **Disabled individuals:** May need help
> **People in crisis:** Might need intervention
> 
> **Example:** Friend is suicidal
> - **Ethical Egoist:** "Not my problem, they can handle it"
> - **Common Sense:** You should help them!

**3. Self-Interest Can Lead to Blatantly Immoral Behavior**

**Problem:** Short-term self-interest can justify terrible actions

**Examples:**

**Corruption:**
> **Government Official:**
> - Self-interest: Accept $1 million bribe
> - Consequence: Approve dangerous construction project
> - Result: Building collapses, people die
> - **Ethical Egoism:** If official doesn't get caught, action was "moral"

**Environmental Destruction:**
> **Factory Owner:**
> - Self-interest: Dump toxic waste instead of proper disposal (saves millions)
> - Consequence: River poisoned, community gets sick
> - **Ethical Egoism:** If owner doesn't face consequences, action was "moral"

**Corporate Fraud:**
> **Enron Executives:**
> - Self-interest: Manipulate accounting, sell stock before collapse
> - Consequence: Thousands lose jobs and retirement savings
> - **Ethical Egoism:** Executives got rich, so they acted "morally"

**4. Other Moral Principles Superior to Self-Interest**

**Problem:** Some principles more fundamental than self-interest

**Examples:**

**Justice:**
> **Scenario:** You witness a crime
> - **Self-interest:** Don't testify (avoid hassle, potential retaliation)
> - **Justice:** Testify to ensure criminal faces consequences
> 
> **Most people:** Choose justice over self-interest

**Loyalty:**
> **Scenario:** Your company's competitor offers you job for double salary if you bring trade secrets
> - **Self-interest:** Take the offer
> - **Loyalty:** Refuse, honor your commitment
> 
> **Most people:** Value loyalty over short-term gain

**5. People Who Consider Others Are Happier**

**Empirical Evidence:** Studies show altruistic people are happier

**Examples:**

**Volunteering:**
- Increases life satisfaction
- Reduces depression
- Provides sense of purpose

**Strong Relationships:**
- Require putting others' needs above your own sometimes
- Provide deeper fulfillment than pure self-interest

**Research Finding:**
> **Paradox:** Pursuing happiness directly (self-interest) often leads to emptiness
> **Reality:** Happiness comes from meaningful relationships and contributing to others

**6. Doesn't Respect Ethical Point of View**

**By definition, Ethical Egoism is self-centered**

**Problem:**
- Ethics requires considering others' interests equally
- Ethical Egoism says "Only I matter"
- **This contradicts the fundamental requirement of ethical thinking**

**Example:**
> **Ethical Reasoning:** "If I do X, how does it affect everyone involved?"
> **Ethical Egoism:** "If I do X, how does it affect ME?"
> 
> **The second isn't ethical reasoning‚Äîit's just self-interest calculation**

#### Conclusion: Not a Workable Ethical Theory

**Why it fails:**
- Justifies obviously immoral actions
- Ignores others' welfare entirely
- Doesn't align with common moral intuitions
- Can't persuade others (why would they accept your self-interest as moral?)
- By definition, not an ethical theory (ethics requires considering others)

---

## üß† PART 3: Objective Theories (Rationalist Approaches)

### 2.6 Kantianism (Immanuel Kant, 18th Century)

#### Core Idea

**"Act according to universal principles based on duty and reason"**

Morality comes from rational thinking and following duties that apply universally. Your intentions matter more than consequences.
