Case Study: Ann the Acme Accountant
• Ann: Accountant at Acme Corporation
• She distributes paychecks to all 50 employees
• Ann sends email advertising Girl Scout cookie 
sale
• 9 recipients order cookies; average 4 boxes each
• Other 40 recipients unhappy to get email; half 
complain to a co-worker
• Did Ann do anything wrong?
1-13

1-14
Kantian Analysis
• We should always respect autonomy of others, treating 
them as ends in themselves and never only as the 
means to an end (2nd formulation of Categorical 
Imperative)
• Ann didn’t misrepresent what she was doing
• She didn’t force anyone to read the entire email
• Some who read her email chose to order cookies
• Therefore, she didn’t “use” others, and her action was not 
strictly wrong
• However, an “opt in” approach would have been better
1-14

1-15
Act Utilitarian Analysis
• Benefit to Girls Scouts = $108
– $3 profit per box of cookies
– 36 boxes sold
• Harm to company: time wasted
– Orders taken during breaks
– Lost productivity from complaining: $70
• 20 employees ×2 ×5 minutes/employee = 200 minutes
• 3.5 hours ×$20/hour = $70
• Benefits exceed harms, so action good
• Company may create policy against future fundraisers
1-15

1-16
Rule Utilitarian Analysis
• Q: What would be consequences of everyone in 
company used email to solicit donations?
• A: Plenty of employee grumbling and lower 
morale
• If all doing it, unlikely any one cause would do 
well
• Harms greater than benefits, so Ann’s action was 
wrong
1-16

1-17
Social Contract Theory Analysis
• Acme Corporation has no prohibition against 
using its email system this way
• Ann was exercising her right to express herself
• Some people didn’t appreciate message, but she 
didn’t act like a spammer
– She didn’t conceal her identity
– She wasn’t selling a fraudulent product
• Ann did nothing wrong
1-17

1-18
Virtue Ethics Analysis
• As employee, relevant virtues: honesty, fairness, respect
• Ann was honest: her email didn’t mislead anyone
• She wasn’t fair or respectful, and she exercised poor 
judgment (as evidenced by larger amount of complaining 
by co-workers)
• In her role as parent, she did all work herself and didn’t 
find a role for her daughter to play
• Ann should have found a way for her daughter to help, 
and she should have found another way to advertise that 
respected co-workers
1-18

1-19
Summary
• Analyses reached different conclusions, but Ann 
could have taken a less controversial course
• She could have posted a sign-up sheet to 
identify those interested in cookie sale
• That way, she would have sent email only to 
those interested, avoiding the problems of 
grumbling and lost productivity
• She could have found a way to get her daughter 
more engaged

Ethical Perspectives on Censorship
• Kant opposed censorship
– Enlightenment thinker
– “Have courage to use your own reason”
• Mill opposed censorship
– No one is infallible
– Any opinion may contain a kernel of truth
– Truth revealed in class of ideas
– Ideas resulting from discourse are more influential

Mill’s Principle of Harm
“The only ground on which intervention
is justified is to prevent harm to others;
the individual’s own good is not a
sufficient condition.”

establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof; or abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the press; or the

Case Study: Kate’s Blog
• Kate: Maintains a popular “life on campus” blog
• Jerry: Another student; active in Whig Party
• At private birthday party, someone gives Jerry a Tory 
Party T-shirt as a gag, and Jerry puts it on
• Kate uses cell phone to take picture of Jerry when he 
isn’t looking, posts it on her blog
• Story read by many people on and off campus
• Jerry confronts Kate and demands she remove photo; 
she complies, and they remain friends
• Kate’s blog and Jerry both become more popular
1-42

1-43
Kantian Analysis
• Kate uploaded Jerry’s photo to her blog 
without asking his permission
• She treated him as a means to her end of 
increasing the readership of her Web site
• Her action was wrong
1-43

1-44
Social Contract Theory Analysis
• Birthday party held in apartment of one of 
Jerry’s friends
• Jerry had a reasonable expectation of 
privacy
• Kate violated Jerry’s right to privacy
• Kate’s action was wrong
1-44

1-45
Act Utilitarian Analysis
• Benefits
– Popularity of Kate’s blog increased (definitely)
– Jerry become more popular on campus (definitely)
• Harms
– Jerry’s anger at Kate (only temporary)
– Photo could discredit Jerry at some point in future 
(unlikely)
• Benefits greater than harms, so Kate did a good 
thing

– Popularity of Kate’s blog increased (definitely)
– Jerry become more popular on campus (definitely)

– Jerry’s anger at Kate (only temporary)
– Photo could discredit Jerry at some point in future 
(unlikely)
• Benefits greater than harms, so Kate did a good

1-47

1-48
Rule Utilitarian Analysis
• What if everyone were constantly taking photos of people 
they encountered and posting them?
• Positive consequences
– People would have more opportunities to keep up with what their 
friends are doing
– People might be more reluctant to engage in illegal activities
• Negative consequences
– People would become more self-conscious
– Some relationships would be harmed
• Negative consequences more weighty than positive 
consequences, so Kate’s action was bad
1-48

1-49
Virtue Ethics Analysis
• True friends trust each other and seek each other’s good
• Reciprocity and equality are fundamental elements of 
friendship
• Lack of reciprocity: Kate took something from Jerry 
without giving him anything in return
• Lack of equality: She put her own interest above that of 
Jerry
• Kate’s actions did not seem to be characteristic of a good 
friend
1-49

1-50
Summary
• Four out of five analyses: Wrong for Kate to post 
the photo without asking Jerry’s permission
• Kate figured it would be better to beg for 
forgiveness than ask for permission, but she cut 
Jerry out of a decision that affected both of them, 
and that’s no way to treat a friend
• Kate should have tried to get Jerry’s consent

• Location data forms the basis for a multibillion dollar 
industry. For eg, Mobilewalla, has data from 75,000 
mobile apps and 1.6 billion devices across more than 
35 countries.
• Once you agree to tracking, the app will typically refer 
you to a privacy policy that details how that data can be 
used. Very few people read it.
• Free apps are supported by sale of user information to 
third parties. Companies buy data for analytics, fraud 
detection, advertising and marketing purposes.

Chapter 3: Networking - Detailed Explanation with Real-Life Examples

1. Spam:
Spam refers to unsolicited bulk emails sent to many people. It is profitable because sending emails is cheap compared to traditional mail.
Example: You receive an email claiming you won a lottery, asking for your bank details. This is spam and often a scam.
Companies collect emails from websites, chat rooms, or use viruses to harvest addresses. Spam filters help block these messages.

2. Internet Interactions:
People interact online through social media, forums, and messaging apps. However, issues like pornography, sexting, and cyberbullying arise.
Example: A teenager shares personal photos online and becomes a victim of cyberbullying. This shows the importance of online safety.

3. Text Messaging:
Text messaging has transformed lives, especially in developing countries.
Example: In Kenya, M-PESA allows people to send money via text, pay bills, and protect against counterfeit medicine. Farmers share crop prices through SMS.

4. Censorship:
Censorship means blocking or controlling information. Governments may restrict access to websites or monitor online activity.
Example: China blocks certain websites during social unrest. Saudi Arabia uses centralized control to filter content.

5. Freedom of Expression:
Freedom of expression allows people to share opinions, but it is not absolute.
Example: In the U.S., the First Amendment protects speech, but you cannot incite violence or share harmful secrets.

6. Children and Inappropriate Content:
Children can access harmful content online. Web filters and laws like CIPA help protect them.
Example: Libraries in the U.S. must block obscene content to comply with CIPA.

7. Breaking Trust:
Trust can be broken online through false information or predators in chat rooms.
Example: Police use sting operations to catch predators who try to meet children through chat rooms.

8. Internet Addiction:
Excessive Internet use can lead to addiction, similar to gambling.
Example: Someone spends 80 hours a week online, neglecting work and family. Social media apps use notifications to keep users engaged.

Other Issues:
- Identity Theft: Criminals steal personal information to commit fraud.
Example: A hacker uses stolen credit card details to make purchases.
- Tracking Apps: Free apps often sell user data for advertising.
Example: A game app tracks your location and sells it to marketers.

Summary:
The Internet is powerful but comes with risks. Awareness and ethical practices are essential to stay safe and use technology responsibly.
