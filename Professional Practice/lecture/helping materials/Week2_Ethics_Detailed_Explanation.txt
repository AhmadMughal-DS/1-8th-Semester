Why Study Ethics?
• Ethics: a way to decide the best thing to do
• New problems accompany new technologies
• “Common wisdom” may not exist for novel situations 
brought about by new technologies

The Ethical Point of View
Most everyone shares “core values”, desiring:
Life
Happiness
Ability to accomplish goals
Two ways to view world
Selfish point of view: consider only your own self and 
your core values
Ethical point of view: respect other people and their 
core values
1-5
Defining Terms
Society
Association of people organized under a system of rules
Rules: advance the good of members over time
Morality
A society’s rules of conduct
What people ought / ought not to do in various situations
Ethics
Rational examination of morality
Evaluation of people’s behavior

Real – Life Scenario
You are the senior software engineer at a start-up company developing
an exciting new product. Your company’s sales force has led a major
corporation to believe your product will be available next week.
Unfortunately, at this point the software still contains quite a few bugs.
The leader of the testing group has reported that all of the known bugs
appear to be minor, but it will take another month of testing for his team
to be confident the product contains no catastrophic errors.
Because of the fierce competition in the smartphone software industry,
it is critical that your company be “first to market.” To the best of your
knowledge, a well-established company will release a similar product in
a few weeks. If its product appears first, your start-up company will
probably go out of business.

Scenario Questions
• Should you recommend release of the product 
next week?
• Who will benefit if the company follows your 
recommendation?
• Who will be harmed if the company follows your 
recommendation?
• Do you have an obligation to any group of 
people that may be affected by your decision?
• What additional information, if any, would help 
you answer the previous questions?

More on Ethics
• Ethics: rational, systematic analysis
– “Doing ethics” means explaining conclusions
– Best explanations based on facts, shared values, 
logic
• Ethics focuses on people’s voluntary, moral 
choices
• Workable ethical theory: produces explanations 
that might be persuasive to a skeptical, yet 
open-minded audience

What Is Relativism?
• Relativism
– No universal norms of right and wrong
– One person can say “X is right,” another can say 
“X is wrong,” and both can be right
• Subjective relativism
– Each person decides right and wrong for himself 
or herself
– “What’s right for you may not be right for me”
1

2
Case for Subjective Relativism
• Well-meaning and intelligent people disagree on 
moral issues
• Ethical debates are disagreeable and pointless
1
-
1
3
Case Against Subjective Relativism
• Blurs line between doing what you think is right and 
doing what you want to do
• Makes no moral distinction between the actions of 
different people
• SR and tolerance are two different things
• Decisions may not be based on reason
• Not a workable ethical theory
2.3 Cultural Relativism

Cultural Relativism in a Nutshell
• What is “right” and “wrong” depends upon a 
society’s actual moral guidelines
• These guidelines vary from place to place and from 
time to time
• A particular action may be right in one society at one 
time and wrong in other society or at another time
1
-
1
6
Case for Cultural Relativism
• Different social contexts demand different moral 
guidelines
• It is arrogant for one society to judge another
1
-
1
7
Case Against Cultural Relativism
• Because two societies do have different moral views 
doesn’t mean they ought to have different views
• It doesn’t explain how moral guidelines are determined
• What if there are no cultural norms?
• It doesn’t account for evolution of moral guidelines.
• It provides no way out for cultures in conflict
• Existence of many acceptable practices does not imply 
all practices are acceptable (many/any fallacy)
• Societies do, in fact, share certain core values
• Only indirectly based on reason
• Not a workable ethical theory
2.4 Divine Command Theory

Overview of Divine Command Theory
• Good actions: those aligned with God’s will
• Bad actions: those contrary to God’s will
• Holy books reveal God’s will
• We should use holy books as moral decision-
making guides

1
Case for Divine Command Theory
• We owe obedience to our Creator
• God is all-good and all-knowing
• God is the ultimate authority
1
-

2
Case Against Divine Command Theory
• Different holy books disagree on certain 
teachings
• Society is multicultural, secular
• Some modern moral problems not directly 
addressed in scripture
• “The good” ≠ “God” (equivalence fallacy)
• Based on obedience, not reason
• Not a workable ethical theory for our purposes
2.5 Ethical Egoism
1
-
2
3
Definition of Ethical Egoism
• Each person should focus exclusively on his or her 
self-interest
• Morally right action: that action that provides self 
with maximum long-term benefit
• Ayn Rand, author of The Fountainhead and Atlas 
Shrugged, espoused a theory akin to ethical egoism
1
-
2
4
Case for Ethical Egoism
• It is practical since we are already inclined to do 
what’s best for ourselves
• It is better to let other people take care of 
themselves
• The community can benefit when individuals put 
their well-being first
• Other moral principles are rooted in the principle 
of self-interest
1
-
2
5
Case Against Ethical Egoism
• An easy moral philosophy may not be the best moral 
philosophy
• We know a lot about what is good for someone else
• Self-interest can lead to blatantly immoral behavior
• Other moral principles are superior to principle of self-
interest
• People who take the good of others into account lead 
happier lives
• By definition, does not respect the ethical point of view
• Not a workable ethical theory

Critical Importance of Good Will
• Good will: the desire to do the right thing
• Immanuel Kant: Only thing in the world that is good 
without qualification is a good will
• What we want to do is of no importance. Our focus 
should be on what we ought to do. This is called 
dutifulness 
• Reason should cultivate desire to do right thing

Categorical Imperative (1st Formulation)
A categorical imperative is an unconditional rule:
a rule that always applies, regardless of the
circumstances.
Act only from moral rules that you can at the
same time will to be universal moral laws.
(Not fair to make exceptions for yourself)

Illustration of 1st Formulation
• Question: Can a person in dire straits make a promise 
with the intention of breaking it later?
• Proposed rule: “I may make promises with the intention 
of later breaking them.”
• The person in trouble wants his promise to be believed 
so he can get what he needs.
• Universalize rule: Everyone may make & break 
promises
• Everyone breaking promises would make promises 
unbelievable, contradicting desire to have promise 
believed
• The rule is flawed. The answer is “No.”
A Quick Check
• When evaluating a proposed action, reverse roles
• What would you think if that person did the same 
thing to you?
• Negative reactionevidence that your will to do 
that action violates the Categorical Imperative

Categorical Imperative (2nd Formulation)
Act so that you treat both yourself
and other people as ends in themselves
and never only as a means to an end.
Means implies using only for your own benefit, 
with no thought to the interests or benefit of the 
thing that you are using.
Humans are ends-in-themselves

Solely as a Means to an End

Plagiarism Scenario
• Carla
– Single mother
– Works full time
– Takes two evening courses/semester
• History class
– Requires more work than normal
– Carla earning an “A” on all work so far
– Carla doesn’t have time to write final report
• Carla purchases report; submits it as her own work
1
-

5
Kantian Evaluation (1st Formulation)
• Carla wants credit for plagiarized report
• Rule: “You may claim credit for work performed 
by someone else”
• If rule universalized, reports would no longer be 
credible indicator’s of student’s knowledge, and 
professors would not give credit for reports
• Proposal moral rule is self-defeating
• It is wrong for Carla to turn in a purchased report
1

6
Kantian Evaluation (2nd Formulation)
• Carla submitted another person’s work as her own
• She attempted to deceive professor
• She treated professor as a means to an end
– End: passing the course
– Means: manipulate professor
• What Carla did was wrong

Case for Kantianism
• Aligns with common moral concern: “What if 
everyone acted that way?”
• Produces universal moral guidelines
• Treats all persons as moral equals
Perfect and Imperfect Duties
• Perfect duty: duty obliged to fulfill without exception
– Example: Telling the truth
• Imperfect duty: duty obliged to fulfill in general but 
not in every instance
Example: 
1. Duty of self-improvement.
2. Duty to aid others.

Case Against Kantianism
• Sometimes no rule adequately characterizes an 
action. Eg: stealing to feed starving children
• Sometimes there is no way to resolve a conflict 
between rules
– In a conflict between a perfect duty and an imperfect 
duty, perfect duty prevails
– In a conflict between two perfect duties, no solution
Eg: never tell a lie and avoid harming someone
• Kantianism allows no exceptions to perfect duties
Commending someone for a dress.
2.7 Act Utilitarianism

Principle of Utility
• Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill
• An action is good if its benefits exceeds its harms
• An action is bad if its harms exceed its benefits
• Utility: tendency of an object to produce happiness or 
prevent unhappiness for an individual or a community
• Happiness = advantage = benefit = good = pleasure
• Unhappiness = disadvantage = cost = evil = pain

Principle of Utility
(Greatest Happiness Principle)
An action is right (or wrong) to the extent
that it increases (or decreases) the
total happiness of the affected parties.

Act Utilitarianism
• Utilitarianism
– Morality of an action has nothing to do with intent
– Focuses on the consequences
– A consequentialist theory
• Act utilitarianism
– Add up change in happiness of all affected beings
– Sum > 0, action is good
– Sum < 0, action is bad
– Right action to take: one that maximizes the sum
2.8 Rule Utilitarianism

• The case of organ transplant for 5 (useful members 
of society) patients from one lesser member of 
society.
• Refrain from acts that might maximize utility in the 
short run and instead follow rules that will maximize 
utility for the majority of the time

7
Applying Principle of Utility to Rules
• We ought to adopt moral rules which, if followed by 
everyone, will lead to the greatest increase in total 
happiness
• Act utilitarianism applies Principle of Utility to 
individual actions
• Rule utilitarianism applies Principle of Utility to moral 
rules

Anti-Worm Scenario
• August 2003: Blaster worm infected thousands 
of Windows computers
• Soon after, Nachi worm appeared
– Took control of vulnerable computer
– Located and destroyed copies of Blaster
– Downloaded software patch to fix security problem
– Used computer as launching pad to try to “infect” 
other vulnerable PCs

Evaluation using Rule Utilitarianism
• Proposed rule: If I can write a helpful worm that 
removes a harmful worm from infected computers 
and shields them from future attacks, I should do so
• Who would benefit
– People who do not keep their systems updated
• Who would be harmed
– People who use networks
– People who’s computers are invaded by buggy anti-
worms
– System administrators
• Conclusion: Harm outweighs benefits. Releasing 
anti-worm is wrong.

Case for Rule Utilitarianism
• Not every moral decision requires performing 
utilitarian calculus
• Moral rules survive exceptional situations
• Avoids the problem of moral luck
• Reduces the problem of bias
• Appeals to a wide cross-section of society
1
-
5
1
Case Against Utilitarianism in General
• All consequences must be measured on a single scale.
– All units must be the same in order to do the sum
– In certain circumstances utilitarians must quantify the value of a 
human life
• Utilitarianism ignores the problem of an unjust distribution 
of good consequences.
– Utilitarianism does not mean “the greatest good of the greatest 
number”
– That requires a principle of justice
– What happens when a conflict arises between the Principle of 
Utility and a principle of justice?
2.9 Social Contract Theory

Basis of Social Contract Theory
• Thomas Hobbes
– Lived during the English Civil War (1600s)
– In a “state of nature” our lives would be “solitary, poor, 
nasty, brutish, and short”
– We implicitly accept a social contract
• Establishment of moral rules to govern relations among 
citizens
• Government capable of enforcing these rules
• Jean-Jacques Rousseau
– In ideal society, no one above rules
– That prevents society from enact bad rules

James Rachels’s Definition
“Morality consists in the set of rules,
governing how people are to
treat one another, that rational
people will agree to accept, for their
mutual benefit, on the condition that
others follow those rules as well.”

Kinds of Rights
(Classified according to the duties they put on others)
• Negative right: A right that another can guarantee by 
leaving you alone or limiting action against you
Eg: The right to privacy, the right not to be killed, or the 
right to do what one wants with one's property
• Positive right: A right obligating others to do something 
on your behalf
Eg: right to a free education
• Absolute right: A right guaranteed without exception
Eg: the right to life
• Limited right: A right that may be restricted based on 
the circumstances. Typically, positive rights are 
considered to be limited rights.
• Eg: Free education till 12th grade

John Rawls’s Principles of Justice
• Each person may claim a “fully adequate” 
number of basic rights and liberties, so long as 
these claims are consistent with everyone else 
having a claim to the same rights and liberties
• Any social and economic inequalities must
– Be associated with positions that everyone has a fair 
and equal opportunity to achieve
– Be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged 
members of society (the difference principle)
Rawls’s Difference Principle

7
Rawls’s Difference Principle
• Social and economic inequalities must be justified. 
The only way to justify a social or economic inequality 
is to show that its overall effect is to provide the most 
benefit to the least advantaged.
• An example is a graduated income tax system in 
which people with higher incomes pay a higher 
percentage of their income in taxes (See Figure on 
next page ).
• A violation of the difference principle would be a 
military draft system in which poor people had a 
higher probability of being drafted than wealthy 
people.

Case for Social Contract Theory
• Framed in language of rights
• Explains why people act in self-interest in 
absence of common agreement
• Provides clear analysis of certain 
citizen/government problems
– Why civil obedience can be morally right action
1
-

3
Case Against Social Contract Theory
• No one signed social contract
• Some actions have multiple characterizations
Eg: Stealing food from a grocery store to feed my 
starving children 
• Conflicting rights problem
• May unjustly treat people incapable of upholding 
contract

Critique of Enlightenment Theories
• Kantianism, utilitarianism, social contract theory 
ignore important moral considerations
– moral education
– moral wisdom
– family and social relationships
– role of emotions
• Virtue ethics
A good person does “the right thing at the right time for the
right reason”

Virtues and Vices
• Two types of virtue
– intellectual virtues: virtues associated with reasoning 
and truth
– moral virtues: virtues of character (e.g., honesty)
• Moral virtues
– developed by habitually performing right action
– deep-seated character traits
– disposition to act in a certain way and feel in a certain 
way

Summary of Virtue Ethics
1
-
6
8
A right action is an action that a virtuous person, acting 
in character, would do in the same circumstances.
A virtuous person is a person who possesses and lives 
out the virtues.
The virtues are those character traits human beings 
needs in order to flourish and be truly happy.
Vices
• Vices are opposite of virtues
• Vice: a character trait that prevents a human being 
from flourishing or being truly happy
• Often, a virtue situated between two vices
– Courage between cowardliness and rashness
– Generosity between stinginess and prodigality
1
-
7
2
Case for Virtue Ethics
• It often makes more sense to focus on virtues than 
obligations, rights, or consequences
• Personal relationships can be morally relevant to 
decision making
• Our moral decision-making skills develop over time
• With this theory there are no irresolvable moral 
dilemmas
• Emotions play an important role in living a moral life
1
-
7
3
Case Against Virtue Ethics
• Reasonable people may disagree on character 
traits needed for human flourishing
• Cannot use virtue ethics to guide government 
policy
• Virtue ethics undermines attempts to hold 
people responsible for their bad actions

Objectivism vs. Relativism
• Objectivism: Morality has an existence outside the 
human mind
• Relativism: Morality is a human invention
• Divine command theory, ethical egoism, Kantianism, 
utilitarianism, social contract theory, and virtue 
ethics examples of objectivism
Workable Ethical Theories
• We seek theories with these characteristics:
– Based on the ethical point of view
– Objective moral principles developed using logical 
reasoning based on facts and commonly held values
• Workable ethical theories
– Kantianism
– Act and rule utilitarianism
– Social contract theory
– Virtue ethics

Common Approaches to Ethical 
Decision Making
Table 1-5 Four common approaches to ethical decision making
What trends have increased the 
likelihood of an unethical behavior?
•
Globalization has created a much more complex work 
environment, making it more difficult to apply principles and 
codes of ethics consistently.
•
Organizations may be tempted to resort to unethical behavior 
to maintain profits in today’s more challenging and uncertain 
economic climate.
•
It is not unusual for powerful, highly successful individuals to 
fail to act in morally appropriate ways as such people are 
often aggressive in striving for what they want and are used 
to having privileged access to information, people, and other 
resources.
•
Furthermore, their success often inflates their belief that they 
have the ability and the right to manipulate the outcome of 
any situation.
Technology Trends that Influence Ethical Issues
